Restarting your application will fully restart your node, it will not just restart your deployed project. It is equivalent to restarting your server.

== Server adapter
=== Console not shown 	
The server adapter for OpenShift allows you to publish your local changes to OpenShift. It pops up the console after publishing so that you can have a detailed look at what happened when pushing. In Alpha1 the console was not shown any more. We fixed this for Alpha2.
