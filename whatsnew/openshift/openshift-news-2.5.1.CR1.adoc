== Preferences
=== Remote request Timeout 	

There is now a preference available to set the timeout used when waiting for OpenShift requests to complete. We're using a default of 120 seconds (2 minutes) if no preference value (0) is provided. You can try raise this value if you are getting time out errors when using OpenShift.
